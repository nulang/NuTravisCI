This is a simple example showing how Nu can be used to 
build and unit test Objective-C code using Travis CI.

Objective-C source code is assumed to be in the "objc"
directory, and building and testing is orchestrated using
"nuke", the Nu build tool.

Running this locally requires Nu, which is available at
http://github.com/timburks/nu.

The repository is configured for unit tests to pass. 
To see a failure, change "4" to something else in 
test/test_sample.nu.

Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service
offered at no charge to open source projects hosted
on GitHub. For full details see https://travis-ci.org
